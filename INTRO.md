One Saturday morning I got up, I was kind of frustrated because my 2 major passions some how managed to overlap. About 4 months previous to said Saturday I committed to run my first 10k race along with the staff of my company. I'm somehow an ambassador for healthy life and running at my job so I couldn't miss it.
Then GDG came along and decided to move the event from the weekend before to the same weekend as my race, so I was not able to attend any more.
That night I dreamed of what I would have liked to do at GDG and woke up thinking: hey! battleship on line, that's cool. 
So I got up and browsed for battleship katas and stumbled upon these two:

Yet I discovered another very interesting concept beyond katas that mixes online playing and katas REST games. Read it I'm sure you'll enjoy.

So I decide to merge the katas together and create my complete version for Mallorca Software Crafters and here are my tests.
